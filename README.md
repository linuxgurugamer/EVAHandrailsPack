EVA Handrails Pack


This is a continuation of the old Nebula EVA Handrails, made originally by @Krasimir.  He hasn't been around in a long time.  The original thread is here:  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90656-025-nebula-space-engineering-eva-handrails-pack/

Please note that the license for the original mod is very restricted, it is CC-BY-ND-4.0

This license prevented me from modifying the original mod directly.

This continuation is a set of ModuleManager scripts and the original mod included in it's original format.  

I would love to be able to replace the original parts, and if someone would like to volunteer to build some models, it could be done fairly easily.

Curse

This pack adds 9 EVA handrails for space stations and science vessels, more suitable than ladders in weightlessness.

Handrails are usable and can be grabbed by a kerbal while on EVA and used to walk around your space station/spaceship.
